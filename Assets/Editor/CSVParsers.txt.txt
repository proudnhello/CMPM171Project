These files are the CSV Parsers that read the CSVs and create scriptable objects. They also search for collectables and set the newly created SOs in those collectables. They also search for ability SOs and attach them to the newly created AbilityIngredient SOs.

The file paths are defined at the top of the file, make sure they are correct.

Collectables need to have the same name as the AbilityIngredient to be set correctly.
